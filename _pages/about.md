I'm a second-year master student at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and a member of the [National Engineering Research Center for Speech and Language Information Processing](https://nelslip.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm).

My research focuses on speech processing fields such as Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV), Text To Speech (TTS) and Voice Cloning.

I am always open to potential collaborations or research opportunities. 
Feel free to contact me at [shengyupeng@mail.ustc.edu.cn](mailto:shengyupeng@mail.ustc.edu.cn).
